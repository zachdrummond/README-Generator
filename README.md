## Description
This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md based on the user's input. A README is fundamental to helping the user understand everything one needs to know in order to use a website properly. This application enables developers to spend more time on their own applications rather than on creating a professional README.

### *Usage*
1. Enter "node index.js" in your command line.
2. Enter your project's information based on the prompts.
3. Look for the new README.md file that will be created.
